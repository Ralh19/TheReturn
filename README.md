# Unity - TheReturn text based came - XAMK University Online Course Project

## Introduction : 

This project is a simple Interactive Text Based Game made in Unity, it was one of the assignments I had to deliver during the Free Online Course ["INTRODUCTION TO VIDEO GAMES CREATION"](https://cambridge-academy-of-gaming-and-innovation.teachable.com/p/introduction-to-video-games-creation) proposed by ["XAMK South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences"](https://www.xamk.fi/en/frontpage/) (35 ECTS).
With this project, I was able to discover the basics of Unity Engine / C#, and thus develop my first mobile application.

## How to Play : 

The game mechanics are really simple: you have a basic interface devided in two zones, the display and the text input, the display the display zone is where thje whole game gonna be displayed : the text describing the situation (where you are, what do you see, where you can go), all the commandes avaliable (and the result of using them). The whole game is played by using commandes.
The commands are :
- `help` : *To dislay all the commands avaliable*
- `go` ***"north","south","east","west"*** : *To go on the direction you avaliable ***(north, south, east, west)*** depending where you are*
- `Ã®nventory` : *To access your inventory*
- `get` : *To get an item present where you are* 
- `examine` : *To examine something on the location you currently are* 
- `talkto` : *To talk to an NPC present on your current location* 
- `say` : *To say something to an NCP (after starting the dialogue with the talk command)*
- `use` : *To use an item*

The objectif is basiccly to complete the story by usign all this commands correctly.
